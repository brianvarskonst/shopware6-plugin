## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/brianvarskonst/shopware6-plugin/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/brianvarskonst/shopware6-plugin/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible. Images or screen-captures are very welcome.

#### **Is this your first time contributing to an open source project on GitHub?**

Great! And welcome to the team!

It's not difficult, but there are some rules to adhere to:

* Work on your own fork. Fork the repo and push your changes to this repo. Create PR when you're done.

* Use feature branches. Don't work directly on the `master` branch, but create a different branch for every issue you tackle. For example `feature/fixes-nasty-bug-x`

#### **Did you write an update that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the change.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

This plugin is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks!
